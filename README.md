# XOR Neural Network in C

This repository contains a simple implementation of a feedforward neural network in C, designed to solve the XOR problem using backpropagation.

## Description

The neural network is implemented from scratch and uses:
- 2 input nodes
- 4 hidden nodes
- 1 output node
- A sigmoid activation function for both hidden and output layers

The learning process adjusts the weights and biases of the network based on the backpropagation algorithm, with a fixed learning rate.
